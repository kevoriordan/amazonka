-- | The amount of instance usage, in normalized units. Normalized units enable you to see your EC2 usage for multiple sizes of instances in a uniform way. For example, suppose you run an xlarge instance and a 2xlarge instance.

Using normalized units instead of instance-hours, the xlarge instance used 8 normalized units, and the 2xlarge instance used 16 normalized units.

-- | Use @Expression@ to filter by cost or by usage. There are two patterns:
--
--
--     * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can filter for @INSTANCE_TYPE==m4.xlarge OR INSTANCE_TYPE==c4.large@ . The @Expression@ for that looks like this:
--
-- @{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "INSTANCE_TYPE", "Values": [ "m4.xlarge", “c4.large” ] } }@
--
-- The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost or usage data. You can create @Expression@ and @DimensionValues@ objects using either @with*@ methods or @set*@ methods in multiple lines.
--
--     * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use multiple @Expression@ types and the logical operators @AND/OR/NOT@ to create a list of one or more @Expression@ objects. This allows you to filter on more advanced options. For example, you can filter on @((INSTANCE_TYPE == m4.large OR INSTANCE_TYPE == m3.large) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)@ . The @Expression@ for that looks like this:
--
-- @{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "INSTANCE_TYPE", "Values": [ "m4.x.large", "c4.large" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] } @
